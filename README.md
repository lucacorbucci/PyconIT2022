# PyconIT2022

This repository contains the source code of the two examples I prepared for my talk ad PyconIT 2022.
The slides of my talk are available [here](https://blog.lucacorbucci.me/post/stories/3/)

### How to run the examples

First of all, you have to clone this repo:

```

```

Then you have to install Streamlit:
